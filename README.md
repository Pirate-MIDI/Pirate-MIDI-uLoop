# µLOOP - The Thinnest Bypass Looper
4 mono loops or 2 stereo loops in an enclosure that fits under the smallest pedalboards - only 22mm thick. Plus a USB MIDI Interface!

This MIDI-controlled bypass looper and USB MIDI interface is unmatched for its compact size and its affordability.
True Bypass loops with a stereo buffered output with MIDI-controlled JFET muting for silent switching.

You can also change the MIDI Out mode to an Aux Switch input and switch the relays or presets with an Aux footswitch - no MIDI required!

Split-Y TRS to TS cables needed to access 4 mono loops.
